  <p class="all">I would like to build a website to help out people by giving them useful information. I would make sure that the information was true before putting it on the website. I think it would be helpful for somebody to get some information on the website instead of checking multiple sources. That is the website I would like to create.</p>
  <a class="thx">Thanks for looking at this website!</a>
